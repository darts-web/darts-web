<p>On Friday the 9th of November the first workshop of Delft Advanced Research Terra Simulator (DARTS) took place. The workshop mainly focussed on 
introducing and learning how to use the flexible DARTS modeling software for geothermal aplications using Python front-end. First part of the workshop 
was set-up using the Jupyter Notebook environment. Setting up a simple simulation test case, initializing the engine, running the engine, and finally 
visualizing the result. Second part of the workshop included the simulation of a heterogeneous 3D model and executed in the PyCharm IDE.</p>

<p>The workshop was a great success, for MSc students and staff members of the Civil Engineering and Geosciences (CEG) faculty at Delft University 
of Technology (TUD). </p>

<p>We are planning to organize several workshops in 2019. If you want to start using DARTS for your research project, interested in next worshop 
participation or have any questions, please contact <a href = "mailto:D.V.Voskov@tudelft.nl">Denis Voskov</a>.
